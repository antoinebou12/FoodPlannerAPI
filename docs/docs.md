To create a C# project on Linux, you'll need to have the .NET SDK installed. If you haven't already installed it, you can follow the instructions on the [.NET official website](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux-ubuntu-2210) to install the latest .NET 6 SDK.
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y dotnet-sdk-7.0
```
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y aspnetcore-runtime-7.0
```

Once the .NET SDK is installed, you can create a new C# project using the `dotnet` command-line tool. In this example, we'll create a Blazor WebAssembly project with an ASP.NET Core server-side API, as described in the previous file structure.

1. Open a terminal and create a new directory for the project:

```bash
mkdir FoodPlanner
cd FoodPlanner
```

2. Create a new solution file:

```bash
dotnet new sln -n FoodPlanner
```

3. Create a new server-side ASP.NET Core project:

```bash
dotnet new webapi -o FoodPlanner.Server
dotnet sln add FoodPlanner.Server/FoodPlanner.Server.csproj
```

4. Create a new client-side Blazor WebAssembly project:

```bash
dotnet new blazorwasm -o FoodPlanner.Client
dotnet sln add FoodPlanner.Client/FoodPlanner.Client.csproj
```

5. Now you have a Blazor WebAssembly project with an ASP.NET Core server-side API in the `FoodPlanner` directory. Open the solution file (`FoodPlanner.sln`) in your favorite C# editor, such as Visual Studio Code or JetBrains Rider, and start building the Recipe and Food Planner application as described in the previous file structure and README.

6. To run the server-side project, navigate to the `FoodPlanner.Server` directory and use the `dotnet run` command:

```bash
cd FoodPlanner.Server
dotnet run
```

7. In a new terminal window, navigate to the `FoodPlanner.Client` directory and use the `dotnet run` command to start the client-side Blazor WebAssembly application:

```bash
cd ../FoodPlanner.Client
dotnet run
```

8. The server-side API will be running at `http://localhost:5000`, and the client-side Blazor WebAssembly application will be available at `http://localhost:5001`.
